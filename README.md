# BistableRing
This document presents python files for the paper ‘Robust maintenance of both stimulus location and amplitude in a working memory model based on dendritic bistability’. 

The spiking model performance in Figure 2 is generated by files in ‘spiking model’. 

The rate model performanc in Figures 3-7 is generated by the rest files.
Figure 3 in ‘Fig3autapse.py’.
Figure 4 (except for 4B,F) in ‘RingDynamics.py’.
Figures 4B,F, 5, and 6A in ‘RingBand.py’. 
Figure 6B in ‘AmpDrift.py’. 
Fig. 7A,B in ‘LocDiffusionVSRange.py’.
