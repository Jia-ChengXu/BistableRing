# BistableRing
contain python codes for BistableRing paper

This document presents python files for the ring model with dendritic bistability in ‘Robust maintenance of both stimulus location and amplitude in a working memory model based on dendritic bistability’. 

The spiking model and Fig. 2 are generated by codes in ‘spiking model’. The rest files are for rate model and other figures. 

Fig. 3 in ‘Fig3autapse.py’. While it is possible to hand-draw the up and down thresholds for each of 10 dendrites in the discrete case in Fig. 3B, we instead use simulation in ‘RingBistableBand.py’, based on the knowledge that autapse and ring give equivalent results under certain conditions. For input and amplitude relation in Fig. 4, see ‘RingDynamics.py’. For multistable bands in Fig. 4, 5, 6A, see ‘RingBand.py’. Fig. 6B in ‘AmpDrift.py’. Fig. 7A, B in ‘LocDiffusionVSRange.py’ and Fig. 7C in ‘LocDiffusionVSAmp.py’.
